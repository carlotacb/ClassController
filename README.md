## Why we create this project... Our inspiration

Bullying in schools is a reality, and some of us, we used to see (or be part) of some of these unacceptable situacions. Also we hear about some projects and papers that talk a about how to prevent this situations on the psicologic way, and after take a lot on them we realize that if all the proces is automatized we can prevent all the situations in a easier way and making the study with more frequency.

## What it does

in a group of students. After answering a bunch of questions, we can visualize which student is seen as a leader for the rest of the group or which one is the person that

## How we built it

For the **Front-End** we use _React.js_ (using _JavaScript_) with _Material UI_ for the components and _Sigma.js_ for the graph visualization.
For the **Back-End** we use _Golang_ for the development of the endpoints and _MySQL_ for the database.

## Challenges we ran into

This was our first time with go and all of it set of tech.
We didn't know so much on what to ask to get good answers and ponderate our graph.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Finishing the whole web, it works better than the MVP that we first thought
Good coordination and architecture

## What we learned

Comunication inside the team
Golang
Gorm

## What's next for class control

growing number of questions and it's diversity and new AI algorithm to detect people, for their leadership and for their loneliness
